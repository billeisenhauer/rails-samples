## FEATURE SUMMARY

This plugin provides for easy externalized configurization in a YML file:

- Common and environment-specific configuration contained in a single YML file.

- Capistrano task to preserve configuration file from release to release.


## USAGE

Place configuration elements common to all environments in the common area as 
demonstrated below:

	# Configuration for ALL environments.
	common: &common
	  app_name: your_app_name_here
	
Place environment-specific elements under appropriate environment as shown
below:

	# Configuration for PRODUCTION environment.
	production:
	  <<: *common
	  google_api: some_long_api_key_here
	
To obtain the values from anywhere in your code, simply access the attributes
of the environment like so:

	puts AppConfig.app_name
	puts AppConfig.google_api
	

## DEPLOYMENT

To preserve the configuration values across releases, call the symlink_app_config
task from within the after_update_code task.

	task :after_update_code, :roles => :app do
		symlink_app_config
	end
	
To update the app.yml file for the first time or for subsequent times, the task
update_app_config can be used as below:

	cap update_app_config
	
This takes the app.yml file from the config directory of the application and
uploads it to the release path on the server.
